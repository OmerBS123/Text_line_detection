# Text Line Detection Using Anisotropic Gaussian Filters #

## Overview ##
This repository is dedicated to the implementation of text line detection using anisotropic Gaussian filters, as detailed in the article "Learning-Free Text Line Segmentation for Historical Handwritten Documents." This innovative approach leverages advanced filtering techniques to enhance the accuracy of text line segmentation in historical documents.

## Project Context ##
This project was developed as part of the Computer Vision Projects Contest at Ben-Gurion University. It showcases the application of specialized computer vision methods to the challenges of processing and analyzing historical handwritten texts.
